Do you often write notes? Of course you do. If you're like me, you will use a mix of;

- Pen and paper (notepad)
- Post it notes
- Scraps of paper
- Phone apps (to-do list, note takers, etc)
- Whiteboard (maybe on the fridge)
- And many more strange and wonderful ways...

Next question. What do you write notes about? Again, if you're like me, they will be a mix of;

- Non-fiction books
- Revision
- Quotes
- Shopping lists
- To-dos
- And more...

Now for the main question. For those notes you take that you need remember long term. How easy is it to remember the content of those notes, 3 weeks or 1 year from now? I bet your answer is “not very” easy. Also, are they organised, accessible and safe? Again, probably not.

This is where RememberMyNotes.com comes in to solve such problems. But how? Here are some of the things it will do.

- Streamline the way notes are captured from direct input into the web/mobile apps to taking pictures
- Automatically parse your notes (from various formats such as notepad, excel, photos, etc) into special formats that RememberMyNotes can use to help you remember them
- Offer various ways to help you remember your notes such as spaced repetition, notifications, tests, email and many other ways
- Optionally share your notes and remember other peoples’ notes from a shared library
- Plus more…

I'm intending to create innovative peer notes as well in both capture, organisation and remembering methods. Such as a group of individuals creating notes together in a group, creating master notes for the whole group to use. But still thinking this one through. Either way, I imagine peer/group notes would be a long way off from being released.

In short, if it's to do with "notes" and "remembering" them. Then RememberMyNotes.com will help facilitate it.

RememberMyNotes.com is something I'm creating to help solve my own personal problems, so am personally passionate about this. I hope, it helps to solve your problems too and helps you to remember your notes!
