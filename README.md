# RememberMyNotes.com

Do you often write notes? Of course your do. If you're like me, you will use a mix of;

- Pen and paper (notepad)
- Post it notes
- Scraps of paper
- Phone apps (todo list, note takers, etc)
- Whiteboard (maybe on the fridge)
- And many more...

Next question. What do you write notes about? Again, if you're like me, they will be a mix of;

- Non-fiction books
- Revision
- Quotes
- Shopping lists
- Todo lists
- And more...

Now for the main question. How easy is it to remember the content of those notes? I bet your answer is not very. Also, are they organised and accessible? Again, probably not.

This is where RememberMyNotes.com comes in to solve this problem. But how?

- Streamline the way notes are captured from direct input into the web/mobile apps to taking pictures
- Automatically parse your notes (from various formats such as notepad, excel, photos, etc) into special formats that RememberMyNotes can use to help you remember them
- Offer various ways to help you remember your notes such as spaced repetition, notifications, tests, email and many other ways

I'm intending to create inovative peer notes as well in both capture, organisation and remembering/learning methods. Such as a group of individuals creating notes together in a group, creating master notes for the whole group to use. But still thinking this one through.

Basically, if it's to do with "notes" and "remembering" them. Then RememberMyNotes.com will help faciliate it.

RememberMyNotes.com is something I'm creating to help solve my own personal problems, so am personally passionate about this. I hope, it helps to solve your problems too and helps you to remember your notes!
